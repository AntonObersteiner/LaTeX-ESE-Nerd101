These are the slides from a presentation during new students' introduction week at TU Dresden, 2022.

You should be able to compile this on any modern Linux machine with LaTeX.
run ```make slides copy open```, see the Makefile to see what this does.

If the old-dwarven stiff doesn't work,
you might want to remove the corresponding input from slides.tex
because this repo does not include the scripts to write new characters.
